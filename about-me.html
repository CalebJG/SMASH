		<p>I usually play video games on my spare time but when Im not able to play them, I would clean up if nesseccary. I dislike getting haircuts because sometimes it takes too long or either I just wanna have enough hair on my head so I won't be cold. I liked having a dark space to be in but I'll isolate myself when Im in the room. Im mostly the quiet person in class. You will never see me without a jacket unless Im told to not to have one on.</p>
